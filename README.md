This is a React app I made to demonstrate how various computer science algorithms work. I plan to add searching, sorting, and graph theory algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms
#### Bubble Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
#### Merge Sort
A divide and conquer sorting algorithm that uses O(n) merging of two sorted segments.
#### Quick Sort
A divide and conquer sorting algorithm that uses a pivot to sort subarrays recursively.
