This is a React app I made to demonstrate how various computer science algorithms work. I plan to add searching, sorting, and graph theory algorithms.

## Sorting
Head over to the "Sort" tab. The array is represented by a series of bars with random lenghts. 

To get started, just press the button of the desired sorting algorithm and watch it work real-time!
